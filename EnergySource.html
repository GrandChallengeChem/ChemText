        		<p>So where do all these different energy sources come from?</p>
		    </div>

      		<div class="para1">
		        <p>Plants grow by converting solar energy into complex organic molecules via photosynthesis. All biofuels are formed from this energy source. Fossil fuels – solid, liquid, and gaseous – also come from plants having been grown via photosynthesis. Solar power via photovoltaics is also obviously from the sun. Wind power comes from the wind (obviously), but wind arises from atmospheric pressure differentials that are caused by the uneven heating of the earth’s surface by the sun.</p>
		        <p>What about hydropower? Well, it depends upon the evaporation of water and its condensation as rain to keep rivers flowing and dams filling up. The evaporation is again a result of solar heating. Tidal power is most strongly coupled to the moon’s gravitational influence, but the sun has a secondary influence on our tides as well. But one could argue the sun’s gravitational field is what has formed the entire solar system including the moon so tidal power is also a result of the sun’s influence. What about nuclear power? The heavy elements found on earth that are radioactive were formed in other stars which exploded (supernovae) or collapsed (neutron star mergers) – all of which occur by a group of processes known as “rapid” or r-processes– or are formed in stars over longer periods of thousands of years (the “slow” or s-processes).</p>
		        <p>In all cases, these materials were ejected into space to form part of the molecular cloud from which our solar system formed. <br>In any case, you can see that all of our energy sources are really just conversions of stellar energy into other forms that we find more usable. Energy conversion from one form to another remains essential for our civilization as we try to create useful and safe carriers of energy for our use.</p>
