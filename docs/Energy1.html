        The world’s recent past has shown an unparalleled growth in wealth and health. While there are certainly poor people in poor nations who also suffer from poor health, nevertheless, considered across the world, our longevity and affluence is widely spread. While finding ways to spread that wealth and health more fully to all people is certainly an important Grand Challenge in itself, it is claimed here that the tremendous growth in the availability and use of <strong>energy</strong> is central to explaining past growth and achieving future improvement.</p>

        <p>Humanity first started to exploit energy sources when fire was discovered. Plants, we found, and especially heavy, dense plants like trees, were perfectly suited for fire. We used it for warmth and for cooking. It also was used driving new technology, such as the refining of metals and shaping them for new uses.</p>
        <p><img src="images/COAL.jpg" alt="COAL" style="max-width:200px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
        Coal is a rock-like substance that has been known throughout history. Its earliest use as a source of energy dates to about 1000 BC in China where it was being used to refine copper. A Greek report from the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BC mentions coal as “burning rocks”. There is some evidence of its use in Britain in the 3<sup>rd</sup> millennium BC in funeral pyres. Coal became the energy source driving the Industrial Revolution in Europe and America.</p>
        <p>Petroleum has also been known from antiquity. Its use as an asphalt construction material is claimed for ancient Babylon. The Chinese have been using it as a fuel source since 1000 BC and perhaps even earlier. These all came from surface deposits. Hand dug wells, using bamboo as a drill, were developed throughout Asia from the 3<sup>rd</sup> century AD onward.</p>
        <p>Not until the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century did the idea of refining crude oil into its many components start to take hold. Kerosene became the first important product that was used in lanterns for lighting. This drove the development of the oil industry. Many wells had been discovered, but the first commercial oil well was developed in 1858 in Ontario, Canada where a rich reserve was discovered just 4 metres below the surface.</p>
