  			<p>While things like personal safety, economic security, health, etc. have never been better for some people, as a civilization we still confront many big issues. These have been called “Grand Challenges” and many have tried to describe them as things we need to be working on together to help us move further down the path improving life for us all. </p>
		
  			<p>Different groups have outlined their perspective on Grand Challenges. While some differences arise, many point in similar directions: new advanced materials, energy production and storage, CO2 sequestration, climate change, clean water, food security, cancer detection and treatment, the nitrogen cycle in agriculture, and so forth. These challenges all require the participation of skilled, creative individuals from varied professional backgrounds. Government policy and social movements will need to connect scientists and engineers and business leaders – each one contributing in their small way – so that our civilization can continue to move forward. </p>
			
  			<p> <div class="text-img"> <img src="images/BEAKER.png" alt="Beaker and Molecules"> </div> 
  			In this course you will see where the field of Chemistry is an important player in these grand endeavours and you will learn the foundational principles of chemistry and thereby be more prepared to contribute as a future professional chemist or to be able to work more effectively with chemists as you contribute from your particular professional field. Out of the many possible Grand Challenges we could have chosen to focus on, we have selected three to explore in more detail: <strong>Energy, Human Health, and Space Colonization.</strong> </p>
	
  			<p>Through exploring each of these challenges, you will learn the chemical principles and ideas that enable chemists to help solve the issues that keep society from achieving the goals of these challenges. It does not matter which challenge you choose to explore; all of them will develop all of the foundational principles of chemistry. You can switch around, jump in and out of each as you desire. But the goal here is to help you become an informed citizen and perhaps an effective professional whereby you are able to contribute to our civilization addressing and even solving these Grand Challenges. Which Grand Challenge would you like to explore? </p>
