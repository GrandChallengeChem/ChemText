  <p>History records the progress that <span id="hmsp">homo sapiens</span> sapiens (that’s us) has made. 
    From hunter-gathers to agriculture to city-states and nation-states. 
    From empires that rise and fall to the global village we now experience. 
    We are explorers and inventors, warriors and peace-makers. 
    History tells us about our social and scientific progress.</p>

  <p>While things like personal safety, economic security, health, etc. 
    have never been better for some people, as a civilization we still confront many big issues. 
    These have been called “Grand Challenges” and many have tried to describe them as things we need to be working on 
    together to help us move further down the path improving life for us all. </p>
</div>
<!-- /.para1 -->

<div class="para1">
  <p>Different groups have outlined their perspective on Grand Challenges. 
    While some differences arise, many point in similar directions: new advanced materials, 
    energy production and storage, CO2 sequestration, climate change, clean water, food security, 
    cancer detection and treatment, the nitrogen cycle in agriculture, and so forth. 
    These challenges all require the participation of skilled, creative individuals from varied professional backgrounds. 
    Government policy and social movements will need to connect scientists and engineers 
    and business leaders – each one contributing in their small way – so that our civilization can continue to move forward. </p>

  <p>In this course you will see where the field of Chemistry is an important player in these grand endeavours 
    and you will learn the foundational principles of chemistry and thereby be more prepared to contribute as a 
    future professional chemist or to be able to work more effectively with chemists as you contribute from your 
    particular professional field. </p>

  <p>Out of the many possible Grand Challenges we could have chosen to focus on, 
    we have selected three to explore in more detail: <strong>Energy, Human Health, and Space Colonization.</strong> </p>

<div class="para1">
  <p>Through exploring each of these challenges, you will learn the chemical principles and ideas that enable chemists 
    to help solve the issues that keep society from achieving the goals of these challenges. 
    It does not matter which challenge you choose to explore; all of them will develop all of the foundational 
    principles of chemistry. You can switch around, jump in and out of each as you desire. But the goal here is to 
    help you become an informed citizen and perhaps an effective professional whereby you are able to contribute to our 
    civilization addressing and even solving these Grand Challenges. 
    Which Grand Challenge would you like to explore? </p>
