        <p>We have organized this material along three paths, each of which develops the various chemical principles to different levels of sophistication, complexity, and completeness. The “Introduce” level will provide a concise, yet superficial presentation of the discipline of general chemistry. The “Explore” path expands on the introductory materials and provides more explanation for the how and why of these principles. Finally, at the depth found on the “Mastery” level, you will find the complete explanations and elaborations that are common to a General Chemistry course. </p>

        <p>Different people will study this subject at the different levels for different reasons. If your background in chemistry is limited, your first pass through the subject matter may be best done at the “introduce” level of sophistication. You may be best suited to absorb the new ideas and principles in a simplified presentation. Others may be well suited for either of the “explore” or “mastery” levels. You will be able to decide what works best for you in your circumstance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="para1">
        <p>Another rationale for choosing one path over another may be a question of what do you have time for. Perhaps you only have a short time to dedicate to the study and you just need an overview. The “introduce” approach may be best for you. More time will allow you to probe more deeply. Again, you get to choose.</br>
        And you are never limited to the path you originally chose. As you move through the material, you will run into principles and concepts that you find are interesting and useful and may want to learn more. You can then easily drill down on that subject to the deeper levels and see how the ideas can expand. Your choice – and your responsibility.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="para1">
        <p>Tackle the subject of Chemistry through the lens of these Grand Challenges at the depth of level appropriate for your current background and future academic needs. We hope you will find this an exciting and intellectually rewarding learning adventure.</p>
