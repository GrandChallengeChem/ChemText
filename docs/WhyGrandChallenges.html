      <p>Chemistry is a difficult subject for many students. They see reaction equations and mathematical equations and are never sure what they mean. They hear new words like stoichiometry and enthalpy and are puzzled by their significance. One of the problems we have when learning something like chemistry – especially when it is included in our educational program but is not the core subject matter which we are studying – is appreciating its significance for ourselves.</p>

		  <p>Yet everyone is interested in making a difference in the world. Our real aspirations are not about simply having fun on the weekend. If it is, then we have given up on ourselves. We want to be significant and do significant things. This is what Grand Challenges are all about. They are some of the significant things that need to be done in the world.</p>
	
      <p>Grand Challenges are grand endeavours. As such, addressing them will always involve society working together on many fronts, and this will involve lay persons from all walks of life and professionals from all disciplines working together. Chemistry will need to contribute to solutions for all Grand Challenges, just as will Physics, Biology, Math, Computer Science, Engineering, Political Science, Environmental Science, and so on and so on. The critical point is that participants will need to work together and communicate successfully. Everyone needs an introduction to these disciplines so that can work with others and help to solve the world’s Grand Challenges.</p>
  
      <p>We have structured this material around three Grand Challenges with the hope that each student will find one of them to be particular engaging. In all three, we will develop all of the principles of General Chemistry. Each one will be a complete course to introduce all of the fundamentals of chemistry. While you will be able to choose one challenge field, stick to it throughout, and receiving a complete introduction to the discipline, you may also find it interesting to move around to the other challenge fields and see how the same chemical principles will find utility and application in other manners.</p>
  
      <p> <div class="text-img"> <img src="images/BEAKER.png" alt="Beaker and Molecules"> </div> 
      Out of the many possible Grand Challenges we could have chosen to focus on, we have selected three to explore in more detail: <strong>Energy, Human Health, and Space Colonization.</strong> </p>
  
      <p>Our hope is that you will find this to be both engaging and informative. Good luck in your studies and your future professional career. We hope that you will be positioned to make a difference in the world and help to solve some of these Grand Challenges.</p>
